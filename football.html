  <h4>information about FootBall</h4>
  <p>Football is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players each on a rectangular field, where the objective is to score goals by moving the ball into the opponent’s goal using any part of the body except the hands and arms (goalkeepers may use their hands only inside the penalty area). The match is played in two halves of 45 minutes each, and the team with the most goals at full time wins. Players pass, dribble, and shoot the ball while following rules such as offside, fouls, and throw-ins, with free kicks, penalty kicks, or corner kicks awarded for specific violations. Physical contact is allowed within limits, but dangerous play results in fouls or cards, and the game is governed worldwide by FIFA, making football the most popular and widely played sport in the world.</p>
