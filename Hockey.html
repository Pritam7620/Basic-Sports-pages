  <h4>information about Hockey</h4>
  <p>Hockey (field hockey) is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players each on a rectangular field, where the objective is to score goals by hitting or pushing a small hard ball into the opponent’s goal using a hockey stick. The match is divided into four quarters, and players except the goalkeeper are not allowed to use their feet or any part of the body to control the ball. Goals are counted only when the ball is struck from inside the shooting circle, and fouls result in free hits or penalty corners depending on their severity. The goalkeeper is allowed to use protective gear and can stop the ball with any part of the body inside the circle. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins, making hockey a fast-paced game that requires speed, skill, teamwork, and stamina.</p>
