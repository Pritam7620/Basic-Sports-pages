    <h4>information about Kho-Kho</h4>
    <p>
      Kho-Kho is a traditional Indian team sport played between two teams of
      twelve players each, out of which nine players take the field at a time,
      where the objective is for the chasing team to tag (touch) members of the
      defending team within a fixed time. The game is played on a rectangular
      court, with eight chasers sitting or kneeling in a central row facing
      alternate directions, while one active chaser tries to tag the defenders
      who run to avoid being touched. Chasers can change direction or pass the
      chase by giving a “kho” to a seated teammate using correct technique,
      making the game fast and strategic. Each successful tag earns a point, and
      teams alternate between chasing and defending turns. Kho-Kho emphasizes
      speed, agility, teamwork, and quick decision-making, and it is officially
      governed in India by the Kho Kho Federation of India.
