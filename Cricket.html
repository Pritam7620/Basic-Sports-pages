  <h4>information about Cricket</h4>
  <p>Cricket is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players each, where one team bats to score runs and the other bowls and fields to restrict scoring and take wickets. The game is played on a field with a central pitch; the batting team scores runs by hitting the ball with a bat and running between the wickets or by hitting boundaries (four runs if the ball crosses the boundary on the ground and six runs if it crosses in the air). The bowling team tries to dismiss batsmen in various ways such as bowled, caught, run out, LBW, or stumped, and each team gets a fixed number of overs or continues until ten wickets fall, depending on the format (Test, ODI, or T20). An over consists of six legal deliveries, bowlers must bowl with a straight arm, and no-balls or wides result in extra runs. After both teams complete their innings, the team with the higher total score wins the match.</p>
