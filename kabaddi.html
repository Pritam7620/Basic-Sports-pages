    <h4>Kabaddi Rules</h4>
    <p>
      Kabaddi is a team sport played between two teams of seven players each on
      a rectangular court, where one player called the raider enters the
      opponent’s half to touch defenders and return safely to his own half while
      continuously chanting “kabaddi” in a single breath. If the raider touches
      one or more defenders and comes back successfully, his team scores one
      point for each defender touched, but if the defenders stop the raider from
      returning, the defending team scores a point. The raider must cross the
      baulk line to make the raid valid, can earn a bonus point by crossing the
      bonus line when six or more defenders are present, and is out if he steps
      outside the boundary or breaks the chant. Defenders can tackle the raider
      using legal holds, and when all defenders of a team are out, the opposing
      team gets a lona (two extra points). The match is played in two halves,
      and the team with the highest score at the end wins.
